# strongly connected component
In the [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") theory of [directed graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph "Directed graph"), a graph is said to be **strongly connected** if every vertex is [reachable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reachability "Reachability") from every other vertex. The **strongly connected components**of a directed graph form a [partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set "Partition of a set") into [subgraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgraph_(graph_theory) "Subgraph (graph theory)") that are themselves strongly connected. It is possible to test the strong [connectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory) "Connectivity (graph theory)") of a graph, or to find its strongly connected components, in [linear time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_time "Linear time") (that is, Θ(_V_ + _E_ )).
