# Data-intensive applications

An application is data-intensive if data is its primary challenge
- the quantity of data
- the complexity of data
- the speed at which it is changing

#### Tools helping store and process data
- New types of database systems ([[NoSQL]], [[Graph Database]])
- message queues ([[Kafka]], [[NATS]])
- caches ([[LRU Cache]])
- [[search indexes]] (semantic and lexical (AI))
