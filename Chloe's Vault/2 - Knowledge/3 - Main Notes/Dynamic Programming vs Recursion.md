# [[Dynamic Programming]] vs [[Recursion]]

|                     | Recursion                                  | Dynamic Programming                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                     | calls itself to solve smaller sub-problems | break into sub-problems and store the result                                            |
|                     | top-down, tree like                        | bottom-up (solve basic first & combine)                                                 |
| Memory              | low                                        | high (storing results)                                                                  |
| [[Time Complexity]] | can be inefficient (repeated computation)  | Avoid repetitive computation by storing (intermediate) results in a table for later use |
| Example Algorithm   | Tower of Hanoi                             | [[Fibonacci Number (Recursion vs DP)]]                                                  |
